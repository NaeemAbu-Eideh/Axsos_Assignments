Inheritance: I built a class named Library that 
contain all atribute and arguments that i will use it in 
other classes, then I built three classes named (Book, DVD, Magazine)
and make it subclasses that inheret from library, then i give each 
subclass a unique arguments.


Polymorphism: I use override in class functions named 
overdue_notification and late_fee_calculation, each function return the defirrent value, so I make it override
